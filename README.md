# KFC Clone
<p> KFC (Kentucky Fried Chicken) is a fast-food restaurant chain that specializes in fried chicken. The company was founded in 1930 by Harland Sanders, who developed a secret blend of 11 herbs and spices for the chicken that is still used today.

KFC is known for its menu items such as Original Recipe chicken, Extra Crispy chicken, and various sides such as mashed potatoes, coleslaw, and biscuits. KFC operates in over 140 countries and territories around the world, making it one of the largest fast-food chains in the world.</p>
